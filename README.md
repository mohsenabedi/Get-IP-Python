# Get-IP-Python
Get All of interfaces IP's in a range with python using Netmiko Module 

what this script do: 
Get All of IP's in a Cisco Device using Show command and putting output in a file named IP.txt
you can use it with any SSH command line device with a little change as netmiko supports many vendors, it need a little corrections for more accurate output. 

Hope it helps.
